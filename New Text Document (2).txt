Adding bulk

Step 2: Setup the PowerShell script
The only thing that needs to be modified in the script is the path to the csv file, and the UserPrincableName.

To modify the script just right click on the ps1 file and select edit. This will open the script in PowerShell ISE

Modify this section to the correct path of your csv file.

$ADUsers = Import-csv C:\it\Final_NewAccounts2.csv
Now modify line 42 and change the domain

-UserPrincipalName "$Username@winadpro.com"
My domain is ad.activedirectorypro.com so I will update mine to

-UserPrincipalName "$Username@ad.activedirectorypro.com"
Save the changes and move on to step 3.
